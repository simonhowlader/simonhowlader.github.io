## Just incase someone is reading this, HELLO!
I doubt anyone will come across this site unless they're searching for something very specific that's related to whatever I'm working on. If someone is reading this I'd love to know if I made an impact. Let me know at simon@simonhowlader.com!

## Purpose of this blog:
For the next few months I will be working on a bunch of web development projects. Some are personal and some are business related. Most of these projects will require custom backend and frontend solutions. Simply put there will be a lot of moving pieces and configuring. In an effort to procrastinate and delay working on them I had the bright idea to start a blog in order to document my progress with each project. I want to keep a record of my thought process behind each of my decisions and be able to refer back to my steps in case I ever need to replicate something.

I tried to start a technical blog a couple years ago but I stopped after the first post. However, for the past few months I've been blogging about the SHSAT on simontutors.com so I've become a bit more comfortable sharing my thoughts online. I think this blog will be more stimulating to work on as it's going to be about stuff I'm personally interested in i.e. not business related.

This website is served by GitHub Pages and Jekyll and uses the Jekyll theme, Minima.
